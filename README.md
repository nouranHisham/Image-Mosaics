# Image-Mosaics
Computer Vision Assignment 2 part 2: Image mosaics

Problem Statement:

In this part of the assignment, we will implement an image stitcher that uses image warping and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic. 
We will focus on the case where we have two input images that should form the mosaic, where we warp one image into the plane of the second image and display the combined views.

Homography and warping are implemented and then checked using openCV built-in functions.

Further details can be found in the project's report.
